 If true, the player will figure out an affine transform so the video best fits the screen. The resulting video may not be in the correct device orientation though.
 For example, if the video is in landscape and the current device orientation is in portrait mode,
 with this property enabled the video will be rotated so it fits the entire screen. This avoid
 showing the black border on the sides. If your app supports multiple orientation, you typically
 wouldn't want this feature on.
